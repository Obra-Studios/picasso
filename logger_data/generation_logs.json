The rectangle, named \"Rectangle 2,\" is positioned at (125, 164) relative to the frame. It has dimensions of 231 pixels in width and 149 pixels in height, and its center coordinates are at (240.5, 238.5). This rectangle features a solid black stroke with a weight of 4 pixels and has no fills. The overall frame, named \"Frame 1,\" has dimensions of 671 pixels in width and 478 pixels in height, with its upper-left corner at (-206, 493).

The rectangle, named \"Rectangle 2,\" is positioned at (125, 164) relative to the frame. It has dimensions of 231 pixels in width and 149 pixels in height, and its center coordinates are at (240.5, 238.5). This rectangle features a solid black stroke with a weight of 4 pixels and has no fills. The overall frame, named \"Frame 1,\" has dimensions of 671 pixels in width and 478 pixels in height, with its upper-left corner at (-206, 493). The rectangle is positioned towards the upper part of the frame, creating a clear visual hierarchy within the design.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

The rectangle, named \"Rectangle 2,\" is positioned at (125, 164) relative to the frame. It has dimensions of 231 pixels in width and 149 pixels in height, and its center coordinates are at (240.5, 238.5). This rectangle features a solid black stroke with a weight of 4 pixels and has no fills. The overall frame, named \"Frame 1,\" has dimensions of 671 pixels in width and 478 pixels in height, with its upper-left corner at (-206, 493).

The frame, named \"Frame 1,\" has dimensions of 671x478 pixels, with its top-left corner located at (-206, 493). Inside this frame, the rectangle, labeled \"Rectangle 2,\" is positioned at (125, 164) relative to the frame, with dimensions of 231x149 pixels. Its center coordinates are at (240.5, 238.5). The rectangle features a solid black stroke with a weight of 4 pixels, and it is positioned towards the upper right of the frame, providing a clear visual hierarchy and spatial relationship.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

The frame, named \"Frame 1,\" has dimensions of 671x478 pixels, with its top-left corner located at (-206, 493). Inside this frame, the rectangle, labeled \"Rectangle 2,\" is positioned at (125, 164) relative to the frame, with dimensions of 231x149 pixels. Its center coordinates are at (240.5, 238.5).

You must generate instructions for creating additional shapes that fulfill this request.\n\nGiven the existing shape description, generate instructions for creating additional shapes.\n\nSPATIAL CONTEXT & HIERARCHY:\n- The existing shape description is: The design consists of a large rectangle (Rectangle 2) and a series of smaller rectangles arranged horizontally within it. The parent frame (Frame 1) has dimensions of 671x478 pixels, positioned with its top-left corner at (-206, 493). Inside this frame, Rectangle 2 is located at (125, 164) with dimensions of 231x149 pixels, centered at (240.5, 238.5). \n\nWithin Rectangle 2, there are four small rectangles, each measuring 20x20 pixels. The first small rectangle is at (240, 238), the second at (220, 238), and the third and fourth are both at (200, 238). The small rectangles are evenly spaced, maintaining a consistent distance of 20 pixels apart, with their centers at (250, 248), (230, 248), and (210, 248) respectively. The overall arrangement creates a clean, organized layout within the larger rectangle.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

You must generate instructions for creating additional shapes that fulfill this request.\n\nGiven the existing shape description, generate instructions for creating additional shapes.\n\nSPATIAL CONTEXT & HIERARCHY:\n- The existing shape description is: The design consists of a large rectangle (Rectangle 2) and a series of smaller rectangles arranged horizontally within it. The parent frame (Frame 1) has dimensions of 671x478 pixels, positioned with its top-left corner at (-206, 493).

The first small rectangle is at (240, 238), the second at (220, 238), and the third and fourth are both at (200, 238). The small rectangles are evenly spaced, maintaining a consistent distance of 20 pixels apart, with their centers at (250, 248), (230, 248), and (210, 248) respectively. The overall arrangement creates a clean, organized layout within the larger rectangle.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

You must generate instructions for creating additional shapes that fulfill this request.\n\nGiven the existing shape description, generate instructions for creating additional shapes.\n\nSPATIAL CONTEXT & HIERARCHY:\n- The existing shape description is: The design consists of a single rectangle nested within a frame. The frame, \"Frame 1,\" has a top-left corner at (-206, 493) with dimensions of 671 x 478 pixels. Within this frame, \"Rectangle 2\" is positioned at (125, 164) relative to the frame, with a width of 231 pixels and a height of 149 pixels. The rectangle's center coordinates are (240.5, 238.5). It has a solid black stroke with a weight of 4 pixels, and is located approximately 57 pixels below the top edge of the frame and 125 pixels from the left edge. The overall design is minimalistic, consisting of just this single shape within the specified frame.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

You must generate instructions for creating additional shapes that fulfill this request.\n\nGiven the existing shape description, generate instructions for creating additional shapes.\n\nSPATIAL CONTEXT & HIERARCHY:\n- The existing shape description is: The design consists of a single rectangle nested within a frame. The frame, \"Frame 1,\" has a top-left corner at (-206, 493) with dimensions of 671 x 478 pixels. Within this frame, \"Rectangle 2\" is positioned at (125, 164) relative to the frame, with a width of 231 pixels and a height of 149 pixels. The rectangle's center coordinates are (240.5, 238.5). It has a solid black stroke with a weight of 4 pixels, and is located approximately 57 pixels below the top edge of the frame and 125 pixels from the left edge. The overall design is minimalistic, consisting of just this single shape within the specified frame.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

Ensure all new shapes are positioned within the frame bounds and in logical positions relative to the existing design. Respond with a JSON array of shape creation instructions."

Within this frame, there are two primary shapes: a rectangle and an ellipse. \n\n1. **Rectangle 2**: \n   - Located at (125, 164) relative to the frame, it measures 231 pixels in width and 149 pixels in height. \n   - Its center is at (240.5, 238.5). This rectangle is outlined in solid black with a stroke weight of 4 pixels.\n\n2. **Ellipse**: \n   - Positioned at (34.5, 731.5) within the same frame, it has a diameter of 20 pixels. \n   - Its center is at (44.5, 741.5). The ellipse is filled with a solid yellow color and also has a dark brown stroke with a weight of 4 pixels. \n\nThe rectangle is placed above the ellipse, with a vertical distance of approximately 493 pixels between their centers. The overall layout is clean, with the rectangle appearing prominently above the smaller ellipse, creating a clear visual hierarchy.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

Ensure all new shapes are positioned within the frame bounds and in logical positions relative to the existing design. Respond with a JSON array of shape creation instructions."

Within this frame, there are two primary shapes: a rectangle and an ellipse. \n\n1. **Rectangle 2**: \n   - Located at (125, 164) relative to the frame, it measures 231 pixels in width and 149 pixels in height. \n   - Its center is at (240.5, 238.5). This rectangle is outlined in solid black with a stroke weight of 4 pixels.\n\n2. **Ellipse**: \n   - Positioned at (34.5, 731.5) within the same frame, it has a diameter of 20 pixels. \n   - Its center is at (44.5, 741.5). The ellipse is filled with a solid yellow color and also has a dark brown stroke with a weight of 4 pixels. \n\nThe rectangle is placed above the ellipse, with a vertical distance of approximately 493 pixels between their centers. The overall layout is clean, with the rectangle appearing prominently above the smaller ellipse, creating a clear visual hierarchy.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

Ensure all new shapes are positioned within the frame bounds and in logical positions relative to the existing design. Respond with a JSON array of shape creation instructions."

Within this frame, there are two primary shapes: a rectangle and an ellipse. \n\n1. **Rectangle 2**: \n   - Located at (125, 164) relative to the frame, it measures 231 pixels in width and 149 pixels in height. \n   - Its center is at (240.5, 238.5). This rectangle is outlined in solid black with a stroke weight of 4 pixels.\n\n2. **Ellipse**: \n   - Positioned at (34.5, 731.5) within the same frame, it has a diameter of 20 pixels. \n   - Its center is at (44.5, 741.5). The ellipse is filled with a solid yellow color and also has a dark brown stroke with a weight of 4 pixels. \n\nThe rectangle is placed above the ellipse, with a vertical distance of approximately 493 pixels between their centers. The overall layout is clean, with the rectangle appearing prominently above the smaller ellipse, creating a clear visual hierarchy.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

The frame, named \"Frame 1,\" has a top-left corner at coordinates (-206, 493) and spans 671 pixels in width and 478 pixels in height. Inside this frame, \"Rectangle 2\" is positioned at (125, 164) relative to the frame's origin, with dimensions of 231 pixels wide and 149 pixels tall. The center of the rectangle is located at (240.5, 238.5). The rectangle features a solid black stroke with a weight of 4 pixels and no fill. Overall, the rectangle is well-defined within the frame, maintaining a clear spatial relationship to the frame's boundaries.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

The frame, named \"Frame 1,\" has dimensions of 671 pixels wide by 478 pixels high, positioned at (-206, 493) with its center at (129.5, 732).

This rectangle is positioned at (125, 164) relative to the frame, with its center at (240.5, 238.5).

The frame, named \"Frame 1,\" has dimensions of 671 pixels wide by 478 pixels high, positioned at (-206, 493) with its center at (129.5, 732).

The frame, named \"Frame 1,\" has dimensions of 671 pixels wide by 478 pixels high, positioned at (-206, 493) with its center at (129.5, 732).

The frame, named \"Frame 1,\" has dimensions of 671 pixels wide by 478 pixels high, positioned at (-206, 493) with its center at (129.5, 732).

The rectangle features a solid black stroke of 4 pixels, contributing to a clear outline against the white background, and is located towards the center of the frame.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

comments (// or /* */) in the JSON\n- Do NOT include arithmetic expressions (e.g., \"240.5 - 10\") - calculate the values yourself and use the final number\n- All numeric values must be actual numbers, not expressions\n- The response must be a valid JSON array that can be parsed directly\n\nRespond with a JSON array where each object has: type (circle, rectangle, ellipse, polygon, star, line, vector, or arrow), x, y, width, height (if applicable), pointCount (for polygon/star), innerRadius (for star), fills (color as RGB 0-1), strokes (color as RGB 0-1), strokeWeight, and any path data if it's a vector path. IMPORTANT: Use coordinates relative to the appropriate container (frame or group) - ensure x and y coordinates place shapes within the frame bounds (0 to frame width/height) and in logical positions relative to existing shapes, respecting the hierarchical structure."

Within this frame, there is a rectangle named \"Rectangle 2\" located at (125, 164) with dimensions of 231x149 pixels, its center at (240.5, 238.5).

The spatial relationships indicate that the ellipses are evenly distributed vertically along the rectangle's sides, contributing to a cohesive visual structure.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

Within this frame, there is a rectangle named \"Rectangle 2\" located at (125, 164) with dimensions of 231x149 pixels, its center at (240.5, 238.5).

The spatial relationships indicate that the ellipses are evenly distributed vertically along the rectangle's sides, contributing to a cohesive visual structure.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

Within this frame, there is a rectangle named \"Rectangle 2\" located at (125, 164) with dimensions of 231x149 pixels, its center at (240.5, 238.5).

The spatial relationships indicate that the ellipses are evenly distributed vertically along the rectangle's sides, contributing to a cohesive visual structure.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

Within this frame, there is a rectangle named \"Rectangle 2\" located at (125, 164) with dimensions of 231x149 pixels, its center at (240.5, 238.5).

The spatial relationships indicate that the ellipses are evenly distributed vertically along the rectangle's sides, contributing to a cohesive visual structure.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

Within this frame, there is a rectangle named \"Rectangle 2\" located at (125, 164) with dimensions of 231x149 pixels, its center at (240.5, 238.5).

The spatial relationships indicate that the ellipses are evenly distributed vertically along the rectangle's sides, contributing to a cohesive visual structure.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

Within this frame, there is a rectangle named \"Rectangle 2\" located at (125, 164) with dimensions of 231x149 pixels, its center at (240.5, 238.5).

The spatial relationships indicate that the ellipses are evenly distributed vertically along the rectangle's sides, contributing to a cohesive visual structure.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

Within this frame, there is a rectangle named \"Rectangle 2\" located at (125, 164) with dimensions of 231x149 pixels, its center at (240.5, 238.5).

The spatial relationships indicate that the ellipses are evenly distributed vertically along the rectangle's sides, contributing to a cohesive visual structure.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

All numeric values must be actual numbers, not expressions\n- The response must be a valid JSON array that can be parsed directly\n\nRespond with a JSON array where each object has: type (circle, rectangle, ellipse, polygon, star, line, vector, or arrow), x, y, width, height (if applicable), pointCount (for polygon/star), innerRadius (for star), fills (color as RGB 0-1), strokes (color as RGB 0-1), strokeWeight, and any path data if it's a vector path. IMPORTANT: Use coordinates relative to the appropriate container (frame or group) - ensure x and y coordinates place shapes within the frame bounds (0 to frame width/height) and in logical positions relative to existing shapes, respecting the hierarchical structure."

comments (// or /* */) in the JSON\n- Do NOT include arithmetic expressions (e.g., \"240.5 - 10\") - calculate the values yourself and use the final number\n- All numeric values must be actual numbers, not expressions\n- The response must be a valid JSON array that can be parsed directly\n\nRespond with a JSON array where each object has: type (circle, rectangle, ellipse, polygon, star, line, vector, or arrow), x, y, width, height (if applicable), pointCount (for polygon/star), innerRadius (for star), fills (color as RGB 0-1), strokes (color as RGB 0-1), strokeWeight, and any path data if it's a vector path. IMPORTANT: Use coordinates relative to the appropriate container (frame or group) - ensure x and y coordinates place shapes within the frame bounds (0 to frame width/height) and in logical positions relative to existing shapes, respecting the hierarchical structure."

Each ellipse has a yellow fill and a stroke, contributing to the overall visual hierarchy while maintaining equal spacing between the shapes.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

Inside this frame, there is a large rectangle (Rectangle 2) with a width of 231 pixels and a height of 149 pixels, positioned at (125, 164) relative to the frame, centered at (240.5, 238.5). \n\nAdditionally, there are four ellipses, each with a diameter of 20 pixels, arranged in two vertical pairs.

Each ellipse has a yellow fill and a stroke, contributing to the overall visual hierarchy while maintaining equal spacing between the shapes.\n- The DOM representation preserves the hierarchical tree structure (groups, frames, containers)\n- IMPORTANT: Respect the existing hierarchy when positioning new shapes\n- Shapes may be nested within groups - if you're adding shapes that relate to grouped shapes, consider placing them in the same group\n- Use the relativeBounds coordinates when positioning new shapes - these are relative to the parent container (group or frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0) - coordinates at the frame level are relative to this\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner\n- Frame dimensions are provided - ensure all new shapes are positioned within these bounds (0 to frame.width for x, 0 to frame.height for y)\n- Use the relativeBounds center coordinates (centerX, centerY) of existing shapes to position new shapes logically relative to them\n- The x, y coordinates you provide should be the top-left corner of the shape, using the same coordinate system as the target container (frame or group)\n- Position new shapes in a way that makes visual sense relative to existing shapes, respecting their hierarchical relationships\n- If shapes are grouped together, new related shapes should likely be placed in the same group or at the same hierarchy level\n\nDOM representation: {\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Respond with ONLY valid JSON - no comments, no explanations, no markdown code blocks\n- Do NOT include comments (// or /* */) in the JSON\n- Do NOT include arithmetic expressions (e.g., \"240.5 - 10\") - calculate the values yourself and use the final number\n- All numeric values must be actual numbers, not expressions\n- The response must be a valid JSON array that can be parsed directly\n\nRespond with a JSON array where each object has: type (circle, rectangle, ellipse, polygon, star, line, vector, or arrow), x, y, width, height (if applicable), pointCount (for polygon/star), innerRadius (for star), fills (color as RGB 0-1), strokes (color as RGB 0-1), strokeWeight, and any path data if it's a vector path. IMPORTANT: Use coordinates relative to the appropriate container (frame or group) - ensure x and y coordinates place shapes within the frame bounds (0 to frame width/height) and in logical positions relative to existing shapes, respecting the hierarchical structure."

Inside this frame, there is a rectangle labeled \"Rectangle 2,\" located at (125, 164) relative to the frame, measuring 231x149 pixels with its center at (240.5, 238.5). Additionally, four ellipses are arranged in two rows within the same frame: the first row contains two ellipses at (276, 248) and (276, 180), while the second row has two at (146, 248) and (146, 180), each with dimensions of 20x20 pixels. The ellipses are spaced evenly, approximately 68 pixels apart horizontally between each pair in the same row and 68 pixels vertically between rows. Each shape is outlined with solid strokes, and the ellipses are filled with a yellow color.",

Inside this frame, there is a rectangle labeled \"Rectangle 2,\" located at (125, 164) relative to the frame, measuring 231x149 pixels with its center at (240.5, 238.5). Additionally, four ellipses are arranged in two rows within the same frame: the first row contains two ellipses at (276, 248) and (276, 180), while the second row has two at (146, 248) and (146, 180), each with dimensions of 20x20 pixels. The ellipses are spaced evenly, approximately 68 pixels apart horizontally between each pair in the same row and 68 pixels vertically between rows. Each shape is outlined with solid strokes, and the ellipses are filled with a yellow color.",

Within this frame, there is a rectangle named \"Rectangle 2\" located at (125, 164) with dimensions 231x149 pixels, centered at (240.5, 238.5). Additionally, there are four ellipses, each with a diameter of 20 pixels, positioned as follows: the first at (276, 248), the second at (146, 180), the third at (276, 180), and the fourth at (146, 248). The ellipses are evenly spaced vertically and horizontally within the rectangle, with a distance of 0 pixels between the centers of the two ellipses in the same row and 68 pixels between the rows. Each shape has a solid fill and stroke, contributing to a cohesive visual appearance.",

Inside this frame, there is a large rectangle (Rectangle 2) located at (125, 164) with dimensions 231x149 pixels, centered at (240.5, 238.5). \n\nWithin the same frame, there are multiple ellipses: four yellow ellipses positioned at (276, 248), (146, 180), (276, 180), and (146, 248), each with a diameter of 20 pixels, and a blue ellipse at (286, 258) with a diameter of 10 pixels. Additionally, there are smaller ellipses in green and red, positioned at (221, 258) and (221, 224) respectively, with diameters of 30 and 5 pixels. The spatial relationships show that the yellow ellipses are evenly distributed around the blue ellipse, creating a balanced visual composition within the frame.",

Include specific pixel positions, coordinates, spatial relationships, AND hierarchical structure.\n\nCRITICAL: FIGMA COORDINATE SYSTEM:\n- In Figma, the y-axis is FLIPPED from conventional coordinate systems\n- y=0 is at the TOP of the frame/document\n- Higher y values mean LOWER on the screen (closer to the bottom)\n- Lower y values mean HIGHER on the screen (closer to the top)\n- When describing positions, explicitly state \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\", \"right\" based on visual appearance\n- Example: A shape at y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape at y=248, even though 180 < 248\n\nHIERARCHY AWARENESS:\n- The structure preserves the tree-like hierarchy of the design (groups, frames, containers)\n- Shapes may be nested within groups or other containers\n- Use the 'relativeBounds' coordinates (not 'bounds') when describing positions - these are relative to the parent container (group/frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group, not the frame\n\nFor each shape, mention:\n- Exact pixel positions using relativeBounds (x, y coordinates relative to parent container)\n- Visual position (top/bottom/left/right) to clarify despite the flipped y-axis\n- Center coordinates from relativeBounds (centerX, centerY relative to parent)\n- Dimensions (width x height in pixels)\n- Which group or container it belongs to (if nested)\n- Spatial relationships between shapes with specific pixel distances and visual directions\n- Frame dimensions and how shapes are positioned within the frame\n\nUse specific numbers from the relativeBounds data.

The frame, named \"Frame 1,\" has dimensions of 671 pixels wide and 478 pixels tall, positioned at (-206, 493) in the Figma coordinate system. \n\nInside this frame, the first rectangle, \"Rectangle 2,\" is located at (125, 164) relative to its parent, with dimensions of 231 pixels wide and 149 pixels tall. It visually sits at the top of the frame. Below this rectangle, two ellipses are positioned: the first at (276, 248) and the second at (276, 180), both having a diameter of 20 pixels. The remaining two ellipses are located at (146, 248) and (146, 180), also with a diameter of 20 pixels. The ellipses are evenly spaced within the rectangle, creating a balanced visual arrangement. \n\nOverall, the design features a clear hierarchy with the rectangle as the primary shape, and the ellipses serving as decorative elements within it.",

Y-AXIS IS REVERSED:\n   - y=0 is at the TOP of the frame/document\n   - Higher y values mean LOWER on the screen (closer to the bottom)\n   - Lower y values mean HIGHER on the screen (closer to the top)\n   - Example: A shape at y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape at y=248, even though 180 < 248\n   - When describing positions, always explicitly state \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\", \"right\" based on visual appearance\n   - When identifying shapes, always clarify visual position (top/bottom) to avoid confusion\n\n2. COORDINATES MEASURE TOP-LEFT CORNER:\n   - All x, y coordinates in Figma represent the TOP-LEFT corner of the object's bounding box\n   - This is NOT the center of the object\n   - To position an object at a specific center point, you must calculate: x = centerX - (width / 2), y = centerY - (height / 2)\n   - Example: To center a 100x50 rectangle at (200, 300), set x = 200 - 50 = 150, y = 300 - 25 = 275\n   - When working with center coordinates (centerX, centerY), always account for the object's width and height\n\n3. COORDINATE RELATIVITY:\n   - Coordinates are relative to the parent container (frame or group)\n   - The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n   - Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner, not the frame\n   - When positioning shapes, ensure coordinates are relative to the appropriate parent container\n\n4. VISUAL POSITIONING:\n   - Always think in terms of visual appearance, not just numerical values\n   - Use descriptive terms (top, bottom, left, right) alongside coordinates\n   - Remember: smaller y = visually higher, larger y = visually lower\n\nBased on the following DOM-like representation of shapes (rectangles, circles, polygons, stars, lines, vectors, etc.), provide a clear, concise description of what this design looks like. Include specific pixel positions, coordinates, spatial relationships, AND hierarchical structure.\n\nHIERARCHY AWARENESS:\n- The structure preserves the tree-like hierarchy of the design (groups, frames, containers)\n- Shapes may be nested within groups or other containers\n- Use the 'relativeBounds' coordinates (not 'bounds') when describing positions - these are relative to the parent container (group/frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group, not the frame\n\nFor each shape, mention:\n- Exact pixel positions using relativeBounds (x, y coordinates relative to parent container) - remember these are TOP-LEFT corner coordinates\n- Visual position (top/bottom/left/right) to clarify despite the flipped y-axis\n- Center coordinates from relativeBounds (centerX, centerY relative to parent)\n- Dimensions (width x height in pixels)\n- Which group or container it belongs to (if nested)\n- Spatial relationships between shapes with specific pixel distances and visual directions\n- Frame dimensions and how shapes are positioned within the frame\n\nUse specific numbers from the relativeBounds data. Keep it to 4-5 sentences:\n\n{\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

              "content": "CRITICAL: FIGMA COORDINATE SYSTEM CONTEXT\n\nFigma uses a coordinate system with important characteristics that differ from conventional mathematical coordinate systems:\n\n1. Y-AXIS IS REVERSED:\n   - y=0 is at the TOP of the frame/document\n   - Higher y values mean LOWER on the screen (closer to the bottom)\n   - Lower y values mean HIGHER on the screen (closer to the top)\n   - Example: A shape at y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape at y=248, even though 180 < 248\n   - When describing positions, always explicitly state \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\", \"right\" based on visual appearance\n   - When identifying shapes, always clarify visual position (top/bottom) to avoid confusion\n\n2. COORDINATES MEASURE TOP-LEFT CORNER:\n   - All x, y coordinates in Figma represent the TOP-LEFT corner of the object's bounding box\n   - This is NOT the center of the object\n   - To position an object at a specific center point, you must calculate: x = centerX - (width / 2), y = centerY - (height / 2)\n   - Example: To center a 100x50 rectangle at (200, 300), set x = 200 - 50 = 150, y = 300 - 25 = 275\n   - When working with center coordinates (centerX, centerY), always account for the object's width and height\n\n3. COORDINATE RELATIVITY:\n   - Coordinates are relative to the parent container (frame or group)\n   - The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n   - Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner, not the frame\n   - When positioning shapes, ensure coordinates are relative to the appropriate parent container\n\n4. VISUAL POSITIONING:\n   - Always think in terms of visual appearance, not just numerical values\n   - Use descriptive terms (top, bottom, left, right) alongside coordinates\n   - Remember: smaller y = visually higher, larger y = visually lower\n\nBased on the following detailed plan, generate a JSON structure that specifies exactly which Figma primitives need to be added or modified.\n\nPLAN:\n### Design Modification Plan\n\n#### ADD Operations\n\n1. **Add Red Circle (Right Side)**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (286, 248) \n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the two yellow circles on the right side (Top Right Ellipse at (276, 248) and Bottom Right Ellipse at (276, 180)).\n     - **Midpoint Calculation**: \n       - Midpoint X: (286 + 286) / 2 = 286\n       - Midpoint Y: (248 + 180) / 2 = 214\n   - **Size**: 10 x 10 pixels\n   - **Colors**: \n     - Fill: RGB(1, 0, 0) (Red)\n     - Stroke: RGB(0, 0, 0) (Black)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 2 pixels\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n2. **Add Red Circle (Left Side)**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (156, 248) \n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the two yellow circles on the left side (Bottom Left Ellipse at (146, 180) and Bottom Ellipse at (146, 248)).\n     - **Midpoint Calculation**: \n       - Midpoint X: (156 + 156) / 2 = 156\n       - Midpoint Y: (180 + 248) / 2 = 214\n   - **Size**: 10 x 10 pixels\n   - **Colors**: \n     - Fill: RGB(1, 0, 0) (Red)\n     - Stroke: RGB(0, 0, 0) (Black)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 2 pixels\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n3. **Add Blue Circle**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (276, 238) \n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the top pair of yellow circles (Top Left Ellipse at (146, 248) and Top Right Ellipse at (276, 248)).\n     - **Midpoint Calculation**: \n       - Midpoint X: (156 + 286) / 2 = 221\n       - Midpoint Y: 248 (same y-coordinate)\n   - **Size**: 30 x 30 pixels\n   - **Colors**: \n     - Fill: RGB(0, 0, 1) (Blue)\n     - Stroke: RGB(0, 0, 0) (Black)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 2 pixels\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n4. **Add Green Circle**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (156, 238) \n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the bottom pair of yellow circles (Bottom Left Ellipse at (146, 180) and Bottom Ellipse at (146, 248)).\n     - **Midpoint Calculation**: \n       - Midpoint X: (156 + 156) / 2 = 156\n       - Midpoint Y: (190 + 258) / 2 = 224\n   - **Size**: 5 x 5 pixels\n   - **Colors**: \n     - Fill: RGB(0, 1, 0) (Green)\n     - Stroke: RGB(0, 0, 0) (Black)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 1 pixel\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n#### MODIFY Operations\n\n- **No modifications are required for existing shapes. All new shapes are added as specified above.**\n\n### Summary\nThis plan outlines the addition of four new circles (two red, one blue, and one green) to the existing design, with precise coordinates, sizes, colors, and stroke weights. Each shape is positioned based on the calculated midpoints of the existing yellow circles, ensuring a balanced and visually appealing arrangement within the frame.\n\nEXISTING DOM REPRESENTATION:\n{\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

                  "text": "CRITICAL: FIGMA COORDINATE SYSTEM CONTEXT\n\nFigma uses a coordinate system with important characteristics that differ from conventional mathematical coordinate systems:\n\n1. Y-AXIS IS REVERSED:\n   - y=0 is at the TOP of the frame/document\n   - Higher y values mean LOWER on the screen (closer to the bottom)\n   - Lower y values mean HIGHER on the screen (closer to the top)\n   - Example: A shape at y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape at y=248, even though 180 < 248\n   - When describing positions, always explicitly state \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\", \"right\" based on visual appearance\n   - When identifying shapes, always clarify visual position (top/bottom) to avoid confusion\n\n2. COORDINATES MEASURE TOP-LEFT CORNER:\n   - All x, y coordinates in Figma represent the TOP-LEFT corner of the object's bounding box\n   - This is NOT the center of the object\n   - To position an object at a specific center point, you must calculate: x = centerX - (width / 2), y = centerY - (height / 2)\n   - Example: To center a 100x50 rectangle at (200, 300), set x = 200 - 50 = 150, y = 300 - 25 = 275\n   - When working with center coordinates (centerX, centerY), always account for the object's width and height\n\n3. COORDINATE RELATIVITY:\n   - Coordinates are relative to the parent container (frame or group)\n   - The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n   - Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner, not the frame\n   - When positioning shapes, ensure coordinates are relative to the appropriate parent container\n\n4. VISUAL POSITIONING:\n   - Always think in terms of visual appearance, not just numerical values\n   - Use descriptive terms (top, bottom, left, right) alongside coordinates\n   - Remember: smaller y = visually higher, larger y = visually lower\n\nBased on the following DOM-like representation of shapes (rectangles, circles, polygons, stars, lines, vectors, etc.), provide a clear, concise description of what this design looks like. Include specific pixel positions, coordinates, spatial relationships, AND hierarchical structure.\n\nCRITICAL: When describing positions, you MUST understand Figma's coordinate system:\n- y=0 is at the TOP, higher y values are LOWER on screen\n- A shape with y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape with y=248 (even though 180 < 248)\n- Always state visual position (top/bottom) explicitly when describing shapes\n- Example: \"The top ellipse at y=180\" or \"The bottom ellipse at y=248\"\n\nHIERARCHY AWARENESS:\n- The structure preserves the tree-like hierarchy of the design (groups, frames, containers)\n- Shapes may be nested within groups or other containers\n- Use the 'relativeBounds' coordinates (not 'bounds') when describing positions - these are relative to the parent container (group/frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group, not the frame\n\nFor each shape, mention:\n- Exact pixel positions using relativeBounds (x, y coordinates relative to parent container) - remember these are TOP-LEFT corner coordinates\n- Visual position (top/bottom/left/right) - CRITICAL: smaller y = visually higher/top, larger y = visually lower/bottom\n- Center coordinates from relativeBounds (centerX, centerY relative to parent)\n- Dimensions (width x height in pixels)\n- Which group or container it belongs to (if nested)\n- Spatial relationships between shapes with specific pixel distances and visual directions\n- Frame dimensions and how shapes are positioned within the frame\n\nUse specific numbers from the relativeBounds data. Keep it to 4-5 sentences:\n\n{\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

                "content": "The design consists of a rectangular shape and four ellipses arranged within a frame. \n\n1. **Rectangle**: \n   - Positioned at (125, 164) relative to its parent frame (Frame 1).\n   - Dimensions: 231 pixels wide by 149 pixels high.\n   - Visually, it is located towards the middle of the frame, with its top edge at y=164, making it visually higher than the ellipses below it.\n\n2. **Top Ellipses**: \n   - The first top ellipse is at (276, 248) relative to Frame 1, with a diameter of 20 pixels. It is visually above the second top ellipse, which is at (146, 180) and also has a diameter of 20 pixels.\n   - The second top ellipse is positioned at y=180, making it visually higher than the first top ellipse at y=248.\n\n3. **Bottom Ellipses**: \n   - The first bottom ellipse is at (276, 248) relative to Frame 1, positioned at y=248, visually below the rectangle.\n   - The second bottom ellipse is at (146, 248) relative to Frame 1, also with a diameter of 20 pixels, visually below the rectangle.\n\nOverall, the rectangle serves as a central element, with the top ellipses positioned above it and the bottom ellipses below, creating a balanced visual hierarchy within the frame. The frame itself measures 671 pixels wide by 478 pixels high, with its top-left corner at (-206, 493).",

              "content": "CRITICAL: FIGMA COORDINATE SYSTEM CONTEXT\n\nFigma uses a coordinate system with important characteristics that differ from conventional mathematical coordinate systems:\n\n1. Y-AXIS IS REVERSED:\n   - y=0 is at the TOP of the frame/document\n   - Higher y values mean LOWER on the screen (closer to the bottom)\n   - Lower y values mean HIGHER on the screen (closer to the top)\n   - Example: A shape at y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape at y=248, even though 180 < 248\n   - When describing positions, always explicitly state \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\", \"right\" based on visual appearance\n   - When identifying shapes, always clarify visual position (top/bottom) to avoid confusion\n\n2. COORDINATES MEASURE TOP-LEFT CORNER:\n   - All x, y coordinates in Figma represent the TOP-LEFT corner of the object's bounding box\n   - This is NOT the center of the object\n   - To position an object at a specific center point, you must calculate: x = centerX - (width / 2), y = centerY - (height / 2)\n   - Example: To center a 100x50 rectangle at (200, 300), set x = 200 - 50 = 150, y = 300 - 25 = 275\n   - When working with center coordinates (centerX, centerY), always account for the object's width and height\n\n3. COORDINATE RELATIVITY:\n   - Coordinates are relative to the parent container (frame or group)\n   - The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n   - Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner, not the frame\n   - When positioning shapes, ensure coordinates are relative to the appropriate parent container\n\n4. VISUAL POSITIONING:\n   - Always think in terms of visual appearance, not just numerical values\n   - Use descriptive terms (top, bottom, left, right) alongside coordinates\n   - Remember: smaller y = visually higher, larger y = visually lower\n\nBased on the following detailed plan, generate a JSON structure that specifies exactly which Figma primitives need to be added or modified.\n\nPLAN:\n### Design Modification Plan\n\n#### ADD Operations\n\n1. **Add Red Circle (Right Side)**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (286, 238) relative to Frame 1\n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the two yellow circles on the right side (y=248 and y=180) is calculated as follows:\n       - Midpoint Y: (248 + 180) / 2 = 214\n       - The x-coordinate for the right side yellow circle is 276.\n   - **Size**: 10 pixels by 10 pixels\n   - **Colors**: \n     - Fill: RGB(1, 0, 0) (Red)\n     - Stroke: RGB(0, 0, 0) (Black)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 4 pixels\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n2. **Add Red Circle (Left Side)**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (156, 238) relative to Frame 1\n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the two yellow circles on the left side (y=248 and y=180) is calculated as follows:\n       - Midpoint Y: (248 + 180) / 2 = 214\n       - The x-coordinate for the left side yellow circle is 146.\n   - **Size**: 10 pixels by 10 pixels\n   - **Colors**: \n     - Fill: RGB(1, 0, 0) (Red)\n     - Stroke: RGB(0, 0, 0) (Black)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 4 pixels\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n3. **Add Blue Circle**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (236, 190) relative to Frame 1\n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the top pair of yellow circles (y=248 and y=180) is calculated as follows:\n       - Midpoint Y: (248 + 180) / 2 = 214\n       - The x-coordinate for the top pair of yellow circles is 276 (right) and 146 (left). The midpoint X: (276 + 146) / 2 = 211.\n   - **Size**: 30 pixels by 30 pixels\n   - **Colors**: \n     - Fill: RGB(0, 0, 1) (Blue)\n     - Stroke: RGB(0, 0, 0) (Black)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 4 pixels\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n4. **Add Green Circle**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (236, 258) relative to Frame 1\n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the bottom pair of yellow circles (y=248 and y=180) is calculated as follows:\n       - Midpoint Y: (248 + 180) / 2 = 214\n       - The x-coordinate for the bottom pair of yellow circles is 276 (right) and 146 (left). The midpoint X: (276 + 146) / 2 = 211.\n   - **Size**: 5 pixels by 5 pixels\n   - **Colors**: \n     - Fill: RGB(0, 1, 0) (Green)\n     - Stroke: RGB(0, 0, 0) (Black)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 4 pixels\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n#### MODIFY Operations\n\n- **No modifications are required for existing shapes. All new shapes will be added as specified above.**\n\n### Summary\nThis plan outlines the addition of four new circles (two red, one blue, and one green) to the existing design within Frame 1, ensuring precise positioning and adherence to the Figma coordinate system.

                  "text": "CRITICAL: FIGMA COORDINATE SYSTEM CONTEXT\n\nFigma uses a coordinate system with important characteristics that differ from conventional mathematical coordinate systems:\n\n1. Y-AXIS IS REVERSED:\n   - y=0 is at the TOP of the frame/document\n   - Higher y values mean LOWER on the screen (closer to the bottom)\n   - Lower y values mean HIGHER on the screen (closer to the top)\n   - Example: A shape at y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape at y=248, even though 180 < 248\n   - When describing positions, always explicitly state \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\", \"right\" based on visual appearance\n   - When identifying shapes, always clarify visual position (top/bottom) to avoid confusion\n\n2. COORDINATES MEASURE TOP-LEFT CORNER:\n   - All x, y coordinates in Figma represent the TOP-LEFT corner of the object's bounding box\n   - This is NOT the center of the object\n   - To position an object at a specific center point, you must calculate: x = centerX - (width / 2), y = centerY - (height / 2)\n   - Example: To center a 100x50 rectangle at (200, 300), set x = 200 - 50 = 150, y = 300 - 25 = 275\n   - When working with center coordinates (centerX, centerY), always account for the object's width and height\n\n3. COORDINATE RELATIVITY:\n   - Coordinates are relative to the parent container (frame or group)\n   - The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n   - Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner, not the frame\n   - When positioning shapes, ensure coordinates are relative to the appropriate parent container\n\n4. VISUAL POSITIONING:\n   - Always think in terms of visual appearance, not just numerical values\n   - Use descriptive terms (top, bottom, left, right) alongside coordinates\n   - Remember: smaller y = visually higher, larger y = visually lower\n\nBased on the following DOM-like representation of shapes (rectangles, circles, polygons, stars, lines, vectors, etc.), provide a clear, concise description of what this design looks like. Include specific pixel positions, coordinates, spatial relationships, AND hierarchical structure.\n\nCRITICAL: When describing positions, you MUST understand Figma's coordinate system:\n- y=0 is at the TOP, higher y values are LOWER on screen\n- A shape with y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape with y=248 (even though 180 < 248)\n- Always state visual position (top/bottom) explicitly when describing shapes\n- Example: \"The top ellipse at y=180\" or \"The bottom ellipse at y=248\"\n\nHIERARCHY AWARENESS:\n- The structure preserves the tree-like hierarchy of the design (groups, frames, containers)\n- Shapes may be nested within groups or other containers\n- Use the 'relativeBounds' coordinates (not 'bounds') when describing positions - these are relative to the parent container (group/frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group, not the frame\n\nFor each shape, mention:\n- Exact pixel positions using relativeBounds (x, y coordinates relative to parent container) - remember these are TOP-LEFT corner coordinates\n- Visual position (top/bottom/left/right) - CRITICAL: smaller y = visually higher/top, larger y = visually lower/bottom\n- Center coordinates from relativeBounds (centerX, centerY relative to parent)\n- Dimensions (width x height in pixels)\n- Which group or container it belongs to (if nested)\n- Spatial relationships between shapes with specific pixel distances and visual directions\n- Frame dimensions and how shapes are positioned within the frame\n\nUse specific numbers from the relativeBounds data. Keep it to 4-5 sentences:\n\n{\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

                "content": "The design consists of a rectangular shape and four ellipses arranged within a frame. \n\n1. **Rectangle**: \n   - Positioned at (125, 164) relative to its parent frame (Frame 1).\n   - Dimensions: 231 pixels wide by 149 pixels high.\n   - Visually, it is located towards the middle of the frame, with its top edge at y=164, making it visually higher than the ellipses below it.\n\n2. **Top Ellipses**: \n   - The first top ellipse is at (276, 248) relative to Frame 1, with a diameter of 20 pixels. It is visually above the second top ellipse, which is at (146, 180) and also has a diameter of 20 pixels.\n   - The second top ellipse is positioned at y=180, making it visually higher than the first top ellipse at y=248.\n\n3. **Bottom Ellipses**: \n   - The first bottom ellipse is at (276, 248) relative to Frame 1, positioned at y=248, visually below the rectangle.\n   - The second bottom ellipse is at (146, 248) relative to Frame 1, also with a diameter of 20 pixels, visually below the rectangle.\n\nOverall, the rectangle serves as a central element, with the top ellipses positioned above it and the bottom ellipses below, creating a balanced visual hierarchy within the frame. The frame itself measures 671 pixels wide by 478 pixels high, with its top-left corner at (-206, 493).",

              "content": "CRITICAL: FIGMA COORDINATE SYSTEM CONTEXT\n\nFigma uses a coordinate system with important characteristics that differ from conventional mathematical coordinate systems:\n\n1. Y-AXIS IS REVERSED:\n   - y=0 is at the TOP of the frame/document\n   - Higher y values mean LOWER on the screen (closer to the bottom)\n   - Lower y values mean HIGHER on the screen (closer to the top)\n   - Example: A shape at y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape at y=248, even though 180 < 248\n   - When describing positions, always explicitly state \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\", \"right\" based on visual appearance\n   - When identifying shapes, always clarify visual position (top/bottom) to avoid confusion\n\n2. COORDINATES MEASURE TOP-LEFT CORNER:\n   - All x, y coordinates in Figma represent the TOP-LEFT corner of the object's bounding box\n   - This is NOT the center of the object\n   - To position an object at a specific center point, you must calculate: x = centerX - (width / 2), y = centerY - (height / 2)\n   - Example: To center a 100x50 rectangle at (200, 300), set x = 200 - 50 = 150, y = 300 - 25 = 275\n   - When working with center coordinates (centerX, centerY), always account for the object's width and height\n\n3. COORDINATE RELATIVITY:\n   - Coordinates are relative to the parent container (frame or group)\n   - The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n   - Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner, not the frame\n   - When positioning shapes, ensure coordinates are relative to the appropriate parent container\n\n4. VISUAL POSITIONING:\n   - Always think in terms of visual appearance, not just numerical values\n   - Use descriptive terms (top, bottom, left, right) alongside coordinates\n   - Remember: smaller y = visually higher, larger y = visually lower\n\nBased on the following detailed plan, generate a JSON structure that specifies exactly which Figma primitives need to be added or modified.\n\nPLAN:\n### ADD Operations\n\n1. **Add Red Circle (Right Side)**\n   - **Type**: Ellipse\n   - **Position**: (286, 243) relative to Frame 1 (calculated as follows: midpoint between yellow circles at (276, 248) and (286, 238) gives center at (281, 243), so top-left corner is (281 - 5, 243 - 5) = (286, 243))\n   - **Size**: Width = 10 px, Height = 10 px\n   - **Color**: Fill RGB (1, 0, 0), Stroke RGB (0, 0, 0)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 0 px\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n2. **Add Red Circle (Left Side)**\n   - **Type**: Ellipse\n   - **Position**: (161, 243) relative to Frame 1 (calculated as follows: midpoint between yellow circles at (146, 248) and (156, 238) gives center at (151, 243), so top-left corner is (151 - 5, 243 - 5) = (161, 243))\n   - **Size**: Width = 10 px, Height = 10 px\n   - **Color**: Fill RGB (1, 0, 0), Stroke RGB (0, 0, 0)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 0 px\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n3. **Add Blue Circle**\n   - **Type**: Ellipse\n   - **Position**: (236, 190) relative to Frame 1 (calculated as follows: midpoint between top pair of yellow circles at (276, 248) and (146, 180) gives center at (211, 190), so top-left corner is (211 - 15, 190 - 15) = (236, 190))\n   - **Size**: Width = 30 px, Height = 30 px\n   - **Color**: Fill RGB (0, 0, 1), Stroke RGB (0, 0, 0)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 0 px\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n4. **Add Green Circle**\n   - **Type**: Ellipse\n   - **Position**: (236, 258) relative to Frame 1 (calculated as follows: midpoint between bottom pair of yellow circles at (276, 248) and (146, 248) gives center at (211, 258), so top-left corner is (211 - 2.5, 258 - 2.5) = (236, 258))\n   - **Size**: Width = 5 px, Height = 5 px\n   - **Color**: Fill RGB (0, 1, 0), Stroke RGB (0, 0, 0)\n   - **Stroke Weight**: 0 px\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n### MODIFY Operations\n\n(No modifications are required for existing shapes as all new shapes are being added.) \n\n### Summary\n- Four new shapes will be added to Frame 1: two red circles positioned between the yellow circles on the left and right, a blue circle positioned between the top pair of yellow circles, and a green circle positioned between the bottom pair of yellow circles. All shapes will have no stroke width.\n\nEXISTING DOM REPRESENTATION:\n{\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.

                  "text": "CRITICAL: FIGMA COORDINATE SYSTEM CONTEXT\n\nFigma uses a coordinate system with important characteristics that differ from conventional mathematical coordinate systems:\n\n1. Y-AXIS IS REVERSED:\n   - y=0 is at the TOP of the frame/document\n   - Higher y values mean LOWER on the screen (closer to the bottom)\n   - Lower y values mean HIGHER on the screen (closer to the top)\n   - Example: A shape at y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape at y=248, even though 180 < 248\n   - When describing positions, always explicitly state \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\", \"right\" based on visual appearance\n   - When identifying shapes, always clarify visual position (top/bottom) to avoid confusion\n\n2. COORDINATES MEASURE TOP-LEFT CORNER:\n   - All x, y coordinates in Figma represent the TOP-LEFT corner of the object's bounding box\n   - This is NOT the center of the object\n   - To position an object at a specific center point, you must calculate: x = centerX - (width / 2), y = centerY - (height / 2)\n   - Example: To center a 100x50 rectangle at (200, 300), set x = 200 - 50 = 150, y = 300 - 25 = 275\n   - When working with center coordinates (centerX, centerY), always account for the object's width and height\n\n3. COORDINATE RELATIVITY:\n   - Coordinates are relative to the parent container (frame or group)\n   - The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n   - Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner, not the frame\n   - When positioning shapes, ensure coordinates are relative to the appropriate parent container\n\n4. VISUAL POSITIONING:\n   - Always think in terms of visual appearance, not just numerical values\n   - Use descriptive terms (top, bottom, left, right) alongside coordinates\n   - Remember: smaller y = visually higher, larger y = visually lower\n\nBased on the following DOM-like representation of shapes (rectangles, circles, polygons, stars, lines, vectors, etc.), provide a clear, concise description of what this design looks like. Include specific pixel positions, coordinates, spatial relationships, AND hierarchical structure.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL: FIGMA Y-AXIS REVERSAL - READ THIS CAREFULLY \u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nFigma's coordinate system is REVERSED from normal mathematical coordinates:\n- y=0 is at the TOP of the frame\n- SMALLER y values = VISUALLY HIGHER (closer to top of screen)\n- LARGER y values = VISUALLY LOWER (closer to bottom of screen)\n\nEXAMPLES TO MEMORIZE:\n- A shape at y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape at y=248 (even though 180 < 248 numerically)\n- If you see y=180 and y=248, the shape at y=180 is the TOP one, y=248 is the BOTTOM one\n- NEVER say \"high y value = top\" - that is WRONG. High y value = BOTTOM\n- ALWAYS say: \"smaller y = top\", \"larger y = bottom\"\n\nWHEN DESCRIBING SHAPES:\n- For shapes with smaller y values, say \"top\" or \"visually higher\"\n- For shapes with larger y values, say \"bottom\" or \"visually lower\"\n- Example: \"The top ellipse at y=180\" (smaller y = top)\n- Example: \"The bottom ellipse at y=248\" (larger y = bottom)\n\nSCREENSHOT WARNING:\n- If a screenshot is provided, DO NOT let it confuse you about coordinates\n- The screenshot shows visual appearance, but coordinates are what matter\n- Trust the y-coordinate values: smaller y = top, larger y = bottom\n- The screenshot may look normal, but Figma's coordinates are reversed\n\nHIERARCHY AWARENESS:\n- The structure preserves the tree-like hierarchy of the design (groups, frames, containers)\n- Shapes may be nested within groups or other containers\n- Use the 'relativeBounds' coordinates (not 'bounds') when describing positions - these are relative to the parent container (group/frame)\n- The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n- Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group, not the frame\n\nFor each shape, mention:\n- Exact pixel positions using relativeBounds (x, y coordinates relative to parent container) - remember these are TOP-LEFT corner coordinates\n- Visual position (top/bottom/left/right) - CRITICAL: smaller y = visually higher/top, larger y = visually lower/bottom\n- Center coordinates from relativeBounds (centerX, centerY relative to parent)\n- Dimensions (width x height in pixels)\n- Which group or container it belongs to (if nested)\n- Spatial relationships between shapes with specific pixel distances and visual directions\n- Frame dimensions and how shapes are positioned within the frame\n\nUse specific numbers from the relativeBounds data.

The coordinate values (especially y-values) are the authoritative source for determining top/bottom positioning. Combine both sources of information to provide an accurate and comprehensive description."

              "content": "CRITICAL: FIGMA COORDINATE SYSTEM CONTEXT\n\nFigma uses a coordinate system with important characteristics that differ from conventional mathematical coordinate systems:\n\n1. Y-AXIS IS REVERSED:\n   - y=0 is at the TOP of the frame/document\n   - Higher y values mean LOWER on the screen (closer to the bottom)\n   - Lower y values mean HIGHER on the screen (closer to the top)\n   - Example: A shape at y=180 is VISUALLY ABOVE a shape at y=248, even though 180 < 248\n   - When describing positions, always explicitly state \"top\", \"bottom\", \"left\", \"right\" based on visual appearance\n   - When identifying shapes, always clarify visual position (top/bottom) to avoid confusion\n\n2. COORDINATES MEASURE TOP-LEFT CORNER:\n   - All x, y coordinates in Figma represent the TOP-LEFT corner of the object's bounding box\n   - This is NOT the center of the object\n   - To position an object at a specific center point, you must calculate: x = centerX - (width / 2), y = centerY - (height / 2)\n   - Example: To center a 100x50 rectangle at (200, 300), set x = 200 - 50 = 150, y = 300 - 25 = 275\n   - When working with center coordinates (centerX, centerY), always account for the object's width and height\n\n3. COORDINATE RELATIVITY:\n   - Coordinates are relative to the parent container (frame or group)\n   - The frame's top-left corner is at (0, 0)\n   - Shapes within groups have coordinates relative to their group's top-left corner, not the frame\n   - When positioning shapes, ensure coordinates are relative to the appropriate parent container\n\n4. VISUAL POSITIONING:\n   - Always think in terms of visual appearance, not just numerical values\n   - Use descriptive terms (top, bottom, left, right) alongside coordinates\n   - Remember: smaller y = visually higher, larger y = visually lower\n\nBased on the following detailed plan, generate a JSON structure that specifies exactly which Figma primitives need to be added or modified.\n\nPLAN:\n### ADD Operations\n\n1. **Add Red Circle (Right Side)**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (286, 213) relative to Frame 1\n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the two yellow circles on the right side (at (286, 180) and (276, 248)):\n       - Midpoint X: (286 + 276) / 2 = 281\n       - Midpoint Y: (180 + 248) / 2 = 214\n   - **Size**: 10 pixels wide, 10 pixels tall\n   - **Color**: Fill RGB (1, 0, 0) (Red)\n   - **Stroke**: None\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n2. **Add Red Circle (Left Side)**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (156, 213) relative to Frame 1\n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the two yellow circles on the left side (at (146, 248) and (276, 180)):\n       - Midpoint X: (146 + 276) / 2 = 211\n       - Midpoint Y: (248 + 180) / 2 = 214\n   - **Size**: 10 pixels wide, 10 pixels tall\n   - **Color**: Fill RGB (1, 0, 0) (Red)\n   - **Stroke**: None\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n3. **Add Blue Circle**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (276, 218) relative to Frame 1\n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the top pair of yellow circles (at (276, 248) and (286, 180)):\n       - Midpoint X: (276 + 286) / 2 = 281\n       - Midpoint Y: (248 + 180) / 2 = 214\n   - **Size**: 30 pixels wide, 30 pixels tall\n   - **Color**: Fill RGB (0, 0, 1) (Blue)\n   - **Stroke**: None\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n4. **Add Green Circle**\n   - **Type**: Circle\n   - **Position**: (146, 218) relative to Frame 1\n     - **Calculation**: The midpoint between the bottom pair of yellow circles (at (146, 248) and (276, 180)):\n       - Midpoint X: (146 + 276) / 2 = 211\n       - Midpoint Y: (248 + 180) / 2 = 214\n   - **Size**: 5 pixels wide, 5 pixels tall\n   - **Color**: Fill RGB (0, 1, 0) (Green)\n   - **Stroke**: None\n   - **Container**: Frame 1\n\n### MODIFY Operations\n\n- **No modifications to existing shapes are required based on the provided instructions. All new shapes will be added as specified.** \n\n### Summary of Add Operations\n- **Red Circle (Right Side)**: Position (286, 213), Size (10x10), Color (RGB 1, 0, 0)\n- **Red Circle (Left Side)**: Position (156, 213), Size (10x10), Color (RGB 1, 0, 0)\n- **Blue Circle**: Position (276, 218), Size (30x30), Color (RGB 0, 0, 1)\n- **Green Circle**: Position (146, 218), Size (5x5), Color (RGB 0, 1, 0)\n\nAll shapes will be added to **Frame 1**.\n\nEXISTING DOM REPRESENTATION:\n{\n  \"documentTree\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCUMENT\",\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"x\": -206,\n      \"y\": 493,\n      \"width\": 671,\n      \"height\": 478,\n      \"centerX\": 129.5,\n      \"centerY\": 732\n    },\n    \"note\": \"The structure preserves hierarchy.
